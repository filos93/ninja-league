> Choose Your Team. Train Your Ninja. Become Kage.

Ninja League is a gamified counter application developed with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Instead of simply increasing a number, players train a ninja, progress through multiple ranks, and can represent an Italian soccer team while unlocking visual upgrades along the way.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to transform a traditional counter application into a more engaging and interactive experience by applying gamification techniques and dynamic user interface updates.

Players can:

- Select an Italian soccer team
- Gain levels through training
- Progress through ninja ranks
- Unlock new ninja appearances
- Receive promotion messages
- Experience team-themed interfaces
- Keep their progress during the session

## 🚀 Features

### Ninja Progression System

Progress through five ninja ranks:

| Level Range | Rank |
|------------|---------|
| 0 - 19  | Student |
| 20 - 39 | Genin |
| 40 - 59 | Chunin |
| 60 - 79 | Jonin |
| 80+     | Kage |

As the player levels up:

- The experience progress bar advances
- The character appearance changes
- The current rank updates
- Promotion messages are displayed

---

### Team Selection

Choose between three Italian soccer teams:

🟡🔴 **Roma**

🔵 **Napoli**

⚫⚪ **Juventus**

Each team includes:

- Dedicated background image
- Unique ninja character set
- Personalized colors
- Team-specific promotion messages

Switching teams starts a new ninja journey by resetting the current progress.

### Dynamic User Interface

The application interface is generated dynamically using JavaScript DOM Manipulation.

Implemented features include:

- Dynamic element creation
- Dynamic image loading
- Dynamic theme switching
- Dynamic rank rendering
- Dynamic progress tracking

---

### Promotion System

Players receive custom messages whenever they achieve a new rank (for now only ITA language supporteed).

Examples:

- 🟡🔴 "You have earned the rank of Genin of Roma!"
- 🔵 "Jonin of Napoli! Your power is feared!"
- ⚫⚪ "Kage of Juventus! You have reached the highest level!"

### Session Storage

The application uses Session Storage to keep:

- Current level
- Selected team

This ensures that user progress is preserved while the browser session remains active.

## 🎮 Why Ninja League?

Rather than creating a simple counter, the objective was to create a small gamified experience where every interaction feels meaningful.

By combining:

the application delivers a more engaging user experience than a traditional counter app.
